# Icelab Development Environment

[Babushka](http://babushka.me) deps for building the standard Icelab Mac OS X development environment.

## Requirements

* [OS X](http://www.apple.com/osx/) (10.9 Mavericks or 10.10 Yosemite)
* Latest available version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Install

### First time

First, [prepare your system](docs/preparing-your-system.md). You must follow these steps if you have an existing Homebrew installation, Ruby or Node.js version managers, or custom dotfiles in your home directory. **After you've done this, open a new shell.**

Install Babushka:

```sh
sh -c "`curl https://babushka.me/up`"
```

You'll be asked where to install Babushka. Accept the default value of `/usr/local/babushka`.

Then, apply our Babushka deps. If you're running this for the very first time, you need to apply a bootstrapping dep first:

```sh
babushka "icelab:workstation bootstrapped"
```

You'll be prompted for some things:

1. To enter your user password.
2. To enable write access to `/usr/local` for admin users.

It's OK to comply with both of these.

After this has completed, _**open a new shell**_ and then finish applying the rest of the deps:

```sh
babushka "icelab:workstation"
```

### Updates

To update your environment, first update the Babushka sources:

```sh
babushka sources -u
```

Then apply our deps again:

```sh
babushka "icelab:workstation"
```

## What it sets up

These Babushka deps are nothing magical. They are merely a collection of jobs that bring your system environment up to a known state by installing things and running shell commands.

The resulting environment, therefore, is nothing special. It is a vanilla OS X web development environment. You should endeavour, therefore, to understand and learn the tools that are installed, so you can work with them directly after they are in place.

### Your environment

[Zsh](http://www.zsh.org) is your default shell, and the [Icelab dotfiles](https://github.com/icelab/dotfiles) provide a common baseline shell environment. These are managed using [rcm](http://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/) and can be combined with another dotfiles directory for personal customization. See the [README](https://github.com/icelab/dotfiles) for more information.

[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) manage and install your Ruby versions. The most recent stable Ruby version is your default.

[nodenv](https://github.com/OiNutter/nodenv) and [node-build](https://github.com/OiNutter/node-build) for managing and installing Node.js versions. The most recent stable Node.js version is your default.

### Your system

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is installed in `/usr/local` for installing and managing system packages.

The following system services are installed via Homebrew and already running:

* [Memcached](http://memcached.org) memory object caching system
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) relational database
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) relational database
* [Redis](http://redis.io) key-value cache and store

The `brew services` command is available for managing these services (run `brew help services` for more information).

These utilities are also installed:

* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)
* [Heroku CLI](https://github.com/heroku/heroku) for working with [Heroku](http://heroku.com) apps
* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) image processing utilities
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) headless web browser, for web app integration testing
* [Raygun](https://github.com/carbonfive/raygun) for generating new apps using Icelab's [rails-skeleton](https://github.com/icelab/rails-skeleton)
* Plus various helpful Unix utilities, including `watch(1)`

## Enable development for particular Icelab projects

As part of this set up, a (private) "projects" Babushka source is installed in `~/.babushka/sources/projects`. This source contains deps to check out various Icelab projects.

To see the available projects, run `babushka list projects` and look for the names under the "# projects (remote)" heading.

To activate the development environment for any one of our projects, run `babushka projects:<project_name>`, replacing the name with anything you saw in the `babushka list` output.

Activating the development environment for a project does the following:

1. Checks the project out into `~/src/<project_name>`
2. If specified, the project's own Babushka dep is run, making whatever changes are necessary to enable development on the project. This dep will be available in the `babushka-deps/` directory at the top-level of the project's codebase.

## Customize your environment with Babushka

If you want to automate your personal system customizations, you can write your own Babushka deps and have them work alongside these ones.

First, make sure you have a space for your personal Babushka source:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.babushka/deps
```

Then create a dep that requires icelab:workstation, along with any other personal deps that you'd like to use, e.g. in `~/.babushka/deps/laptop.rb`:

```ruby
dep "laptop" do
  # Build the standard Icelab environment
  requires "icelab:workstation"

  ### Personal deps can follow

  # I prefer wget
  requires "wget.managed"
end

dep "wget.managed"
```

Then, running `babushka laptop` will ensure the Icelab development environment stays updated alongside all of your customizations.

To share your deps, turn `~/.babushka/deps` into a git repo and push it up to `https://github.com/<your_username>/babushka-deps.git`. See [Tim's Babushka deps](https://github.com/timriley/babushka-deps) as an example.
